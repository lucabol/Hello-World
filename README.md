## Visual Block Editor

This project includes a **web-based visual block editor** for creating C code! ðŸ§©

Open `block-editor.html` in your browser to create C programs using drag-and-drop blocks instead of typing code. Perfect for learning C or quickly prototyping simple programs.

See [BLOCK_EDITOR.md](BLOCK_EDITOR.md) for detailed instructions.
