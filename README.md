# Hello World
Test repo for JediMaster

A simple C "Hello World" program that demonstrates basic C programming concepts and prints its exit code.

## Expected Output

When you run the program, it will produce the following exact output:

```
Hello world!

Exit code: 0
```

**Important:** The program outputs "Hello world!" followed by a blank line and "Exit code: 0" **without a trailing newline** and exits with code 0. This behavior is validated by the test scripts to ensure exact byte-level output compliance.
