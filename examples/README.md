# Visual Editor Example Programs

This directory contains example C programs generated by the visual block editor that demonstrate various features and security handling.

## Files

### hello_basic.c
A simple "Hello World" program generated from the visual editor's basic Print block.
- Demonstrates basic code generation
- Shows proper printf usage with newline
- Compiles cleanly with strict GCC flags

### hello_variables.c  
A more complex program showing variable usage and string escaping.
- Demonstrates variable declaration blocks
- Shows escaped quotes in printf statements
- Tests format specifier handling
- Validates identifier naming conventions

## Testing

Both example programs are automatically tested by the CI system:

```bash
# Compile with strict flags
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Wformat=2 -Wconversion -Wsign-conversion -Werror -std=c99 -o hello_basic hello_basic.c

# Run program
./hello_basic
# Expected output: Hello world!
```

## Generated by Visual Editor

These files are examples of what the visual block editor generates when users:
1. Drag blocks from the palette to the canvas
2. Customize the input fields
3. Export the generated code as hello.c

The security features ensure all user input is properly escaped and validated before being included in the generated C code.
